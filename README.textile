h1. About

BotaBot is bot for jabber (XMPP protocol), especialy for MUC (multi user chat). It can interact with users, save history

h1. Usage

<pre>
# Copy configuration template
cp config/settings.yml.default config/settings.yml

# Edit configuration file. Examples are given in the file.
mate config/settings.yml

# Run the bot
ruby bin/botabot.rb
</pre>

h1. Future

Before BotaBot 1.0 I would like to implement persistent data storage powered by DataMapper, statuses, permissions to execute commands, better console, history plugin and better code reloading.

It should also get a Rakefile with options for RubyGems and be available as a RubyGem.
